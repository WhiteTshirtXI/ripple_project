\begin{abstract}
We have performed x-ray scattering measurements of
the wide angle region of the gel phase of fully hydrated unoriented 
multilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) that quantitate
two satellite peaks in addition to the usual (20) and (11) peaks.
All the peaks in the wide angle region are adequately fit using an
electron density model consisting of straight chains with a terminal methyl
gap and a head group term.  The fit yields chains of length close to 20\AA \ that
are tilted by ${\theta}_{t}=31.6^{\circ}$ toward nearest neighbors at $24^{\circ}$C.
The fit also requires that the two monolayers in the bilayer are slightly offset 
rather than collinear.  Subtraction of the fitted peak scattering and
the background scattering obtained from samples with no
lipid indicates that there is considerable broad diffuse scattering 
underlying the prominent peaks, thus providing a measure of the disorder
in gel phase bilayers.  The result that the head group term required
to fit the wide angle peaks is smaller 
than the corresponding headgroup term required to fit the low angle
reflections suggests that there is less order in the headgroups than
in the chains.  However, the large amount of diffuse scattering appears
to require disorder in both the chain and head regions.
