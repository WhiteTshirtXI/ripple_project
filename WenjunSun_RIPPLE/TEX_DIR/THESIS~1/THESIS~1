Dear Dr. Suter,

Your agreement to join my Ph.D. thesis committee is highly
appreciated. My defense date has been set to March 21, 1996
and the time will be at 2:30pm. The location is Room 6325
(6th floor lounge), Wean Hall.

Enclosed is my thesis. I wish you will like it. I am looking
forward to seeing you at my defense.

Best regards,
