Traces 1 and 2 are from the same sample, with the second trace taken after high
temperature annealing for 4 hours at 80C. The third trace is from a 
different sample (described in the text).

A and C belong to the usual G1 phase, while B and D peaks belong to a new
phase, G2. The E peak is associated with the G1 phase.

raised to 70$^{\circ}$C for one hour and allowed to cool slowly to room 
temperature before this picture. The four prominent wide angle rings shown in 
this film correspond to peaks A, B, C and D as described in the text. The shadow
to the right of the beam was from scattering off the beam stop.
