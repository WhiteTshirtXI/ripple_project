\begin{abstract}
X--ray scattering has been performed on fully hydrated unoriented
multilamellar vesicles of lecithins with even chain lengths n from 16 to 24
as a function of temperature in chain ordered phases. The longer chain lengths, 
$n \geq 20$, show anomalous behavior compared to the shorter chain lengths,
$n< 20$.  This report concentrates on $n = 24$.  Although the history
and time dependence shows that equilibrium was not always achieved, it
appears that there is a second gel-like phase G2
below 40$^{\circ}$C.  The G2 phase has a small tilt angle
and opposite hexagonal symmetry breaking from the usual G1 gel phase.
Also, as T is raised above 45$^{\circ}$C, the wide angle data suggest
the appearance of a phase with hexagonal chain packing and small chain tilt angle.
