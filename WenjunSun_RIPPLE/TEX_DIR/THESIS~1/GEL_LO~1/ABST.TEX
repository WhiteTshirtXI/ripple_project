\begin{abstract}

Systematic low-angle and wide-angle x-ray scattering studies have
been performed on fully hydrated unoriented multilamellar vesicles of 
saturated lecithins with even chain lengths N = 16, 18, 20, 
22 and 24 as 
a function of temperature T in the normal gel (L$_{\beta '}$) phase. For all 
N the area per chain A$_{\mbox c}$ increases linearly with T 
with an average slope \(dA_c/dT=0.027{\mbox \AA}^2/^{\circ}{\mbox C}\),
and the lamellar D-spacings also increase linearly 
with an average slope \(dD/dT=0.040{\mbox \AA}/^{\circ}{\mbox C}\).
At the same T, longer chain length lecithins have more densely packed chains, i.e. 
smaller A$_{\mbox c}$'s, than shorter chain lengths. 
The chain packing of longer chain lengths is found to be more distorted 
from hexagonal packing than that of smaller N, and the 
distortion $\epsilon$ of all N approaches the same value at the 
respective transition temperatures. The thermal volume expansion of 
these lipids 
is accounted for by the expansion in the hydrocarbon chain region. 
Electron density profiles are constructed using four orders of low angle 
lamellar peaks.  These show that most of the increase in D with increasing
T is due to thickening of the bilayers that is consistent with a
decrease in tilt angle $\theta$ and with little change in water spacing
with either T or N.  Due to the opposing effects of
temperature on area per chain A$_c$ and tilt angle
$\theta$, the area expansivity $\alpha_A$ is quite small.
A qualitative theoretical model based on competing head and chain 
interactions accounts for our results.
