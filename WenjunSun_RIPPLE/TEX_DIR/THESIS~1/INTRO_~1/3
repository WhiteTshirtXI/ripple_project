\section{Biomembranes and their functions}
\label{intro_chap_biom}

Biomembranes are the walls or barriers separating a living organism,
be it a cell or a subcell organelle, from its environment. Besides
maintaining the structural integrity of the living entity, biomembranes
have to be flexible to adjust to environmental changes. Biomembranes
are also the places where essential living processes are carried out;
these include the exchange of substances and information with the
surroundings, and the generation of energy \cite{Voet90}.

Living organisms maintain and regulate their internal compositions
through biomembranes. This is realized because biomembranes are
highly-selective semi-permeable barriers which control the flows of
nutrients, waste products, ions, etc., into and out of the organism
through membrane-embedded pumps and gates.

Biomembranes also control the flow of information between organisms and 
their environment. They contain specific receptors
for external stimuli, and in turn, some membranes also generate
signals. Thus membranes play a central role in biological
communication.

In addition, two most important energy conversion processes in
biological systems involve biomembranes.
The first is the oxidative phosphorylation process which generates
and store energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine TriPhosphate) by oxidizing
nutrients \cite{Voet90}; this process takes place in the inner membrane of
mitochondria.  The second is the well-known photosynthesis, in which 
light energy is converted into chemical-bond energy by forming 
carbohydrates from H$_2$O and CO$_2$; this process happens in the inner 
membranes of chloroplasts \cite{Voet90}.

\section{Phospholipids and lipid bilayers as model biomembranes}

Biomembranes are essentially a 2-D matrix composed of lipids, proteins and 
small amounts of carbohydrate. Phospholipids are one of the major lipid 
components in biological membranes. A phospholipid molecule basically
consists of a polar, hydrophilic headgroup and apolar, hydrophobic
hydrocarbon tails; because of this special feature, lipid molecules
are also called amphiphiles. When sufficient amounts of phospholipid
molecules are dispersed into water, they spontaneously assemble into 
several forms of aggregates, including micelles, lamellar bilayers
and cubic phases etc. The driving force of these aggregate formations
is the tendency of hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails to be away from water
in order to minimize the free energy.

Among the most studied phospholipids are the ones with PC (phosphatidylcholine)
headgroups; this category of phospholipids are also called lecithins. A pair 
of a particular lecithin molecule with 14 saturated carbons on each of the 
two chains are shown in Figure~\ref{intro:dmpc}; this molecule is named DMPC 
(or C14, following a convention later chapters of this thesis will use.). 
Saturated lecithins like DMPC, but with longer chain lengths are the focus of 
this thesis.

Phospholipid bilayers (see Fig.~\ref{intro_bilayer}) are often employed as 
model biomembranes, both in experiments and computer simulations,
because pure lipid bilayers have less complex thermodynamic behaviors
than real biomembranes. Elucidating the structures and thermodynamics
of these model bilayer systems is essential for understanding the bulk 
behavior and functional properties of real, multi-component biological
membranes.

\section{Phases and structures of lipid bilayers}
\label{intro_chap_phas}

The supramolecular packing of the bilayers forms lyotropic liquid crystals 
with rich phase behavior and diverse structures. The richness and
diversity of phases and structures result from the competitions and
the balance among many of the interactions present in lipid bilayer systems,
including chain-chain and interbilayer van der Waals interactions, 
interbilayer hydration interaction, head-head electrostatic interactions
etc. \cite{Isr85}.

Noncrystalline lamellar phases observed in lecithin bilayer systems
include the subgel (L$_{c '}$) phase, the gel (L$_{\beta '}$) phase,
the ripple (P$_{\beta '}$) phase and the fluid (L$_{\alpha}$) phase
\cite{Sma86}.
The L$_{c '}$ phase has a crystalline-like intra-bilayer structure, in which
both the hydrocarbon chains and headgroups are ordered. But this in-plane
order doesn't correlate with that of the adjacent bilayers; because of
this, the  L$_{c '}$ is not a crystalline phase. Undergoing a so-called
sub-transition when the temperature is increased, the bilayers go into
the L$_{\beta '}$ phase. In this phase, 
the hydrocarbon chains are basically in the all-trans conformation and the headgroups are
Three of the major phases in lipid bilayer systems are shown in 
Fig. \ref{intro_phase} \cite{Sma86}.
At lower temperatures, lipids are 
in the gel (L$_{\beta '}$) phase, in which 
disordered. At higher temperatures, lipid bilayers are in the
fluid ((L$_{\alpha}$) phase, in which both chains and headgroups
are disordered and the whole bilayers fluctuate around their
equilibrium positions. Fluid phase is the most biological relevant
phase since real biomembranes are all fluid-like, as is required
for membranes proteins to function normally. Gel and fluid
phases have been extensively studied using various techniques.
In between the gel and fluid phases is the ripple (P$_{\beta '}$)
phase, in which most of the chains retain the all-trans configuration,
the bilayers modulate periodically within the bilayer plane,
and adjacent bilayers register with each other to form a 2-D oblique
lattice. The ripple phase has been relatively less studied and its
structure remained unclear. Chapter \ref{rppl_chap} will shed some
light on the ripple phase structure.

transitions between them.}
\end{figure}

As above-mentioned, disorders and fluctuations are important
to real biological systems \cite{N96}. Chapter \ref{gel_model_chap}
will discuss the experimental investigation
on the order and disorder in fully hydrated gel phase bilayers
of DPPC.

To undertand the different roles of headgroups and hydrocarbon
chains in the structure and thermodynamic properties of lipid
bilayers, one strategy is to vary the chain length. This variation 
systematically alters the balance between the interaction energy 
involving the headgroups, which remains the same, and the total 
interaction between the chains, which increases with chain length. 
Chapters \ref{gel_anol_chap} and \ref{gel_long_chap} will show
the results of chain-length dependence of gel phase structure 
and thermodynamic properties. 

\section{Structure determination using x-ray scattering method}
\label{intro_chap_xray}

X-ray scattering is our primary tool in lipid bilayer structure
determination. Some of the key structural parameters of the gel
phase are shown in Fig. \ref{intro_struc}. Using Bragg's law and 
Fourier reconstruction of the transbilayer electron density profiles, 
the lamellar packing structural parameters can be determined from the 
low angle data. Wide angle data analysis will give the 
chain packing structure.

\caption{Definitions of main structural parameters of the gel phase
lipid bilayers. Shown in the right picture is the cross section
perpendicular to the chains, with each black dot representing
a hydro-carbon chain.}
\end{figure}
 
Besides providing information for the ordered and periodic
structure of lipid bilayers, x-ray scattering data also contain
information about disorders and fluctuations. Disorders show up
in the broad diffuse scatterings and fluctuations in the non-Bragg
portion of the scattering peaks \cite{N96}.

\section{Description of thesis}
\label{intro_chap_desc}

The rest of this thesis is organized as follows. 
Chapter \ref{matmet_chap} is the materials and methods section.
Chapter \ref{gel_model_chap} shows our model analysis on the wide
angle results of the gel phase of fully hydrated unoriented 
MLVs (multilamellar vesicles) of DPPC. Chapters \ref{gel_anol_chap} 
and \ref{gel_long_chap} show systematic
low-angle and wide-angle x-ray scattering studies on fully hydrated
unoriented MLVs of saturated lecithins with even chain
lengths N = 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 as
a function of temperature in the chain ordered phases; 
Chapter \ref{gel_anol_chap} shows the anomalous phase behavior
of the longer chain lengths $N \geq 20$; Chapter \ref{gel_long_chap} 
shows the temperature and chain length dependence of the normal gel phase.
Chapter \ref{rppl_chap} shows the study on the structure of the ripple
(P$_{\beta '}$) phase.
