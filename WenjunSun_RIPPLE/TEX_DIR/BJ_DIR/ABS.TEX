The phases of the x-ray form factors are derived for the ripple (P$_{\beta '}$)
thermodynamic phase in the lecithin bilayer system. By combining these phases 
with experimental intensity data, the electron density map of the 
ripple phase of DMPC is constructed. The phases are derived by fitting 
the intensity data to 2D electron density models, which are created
by convolving an asymmetric triangular ripple profile with a transbilayer 
electron density profile.  The robustness of the model method
is indicated by the result that many different models of the
transbilayer profile yield essentially the same phases, except
for the weaker, purely ripple (0,k) peaks.  Even with this
residual ambiguity, the ripple profile is well determined, resulting in
19\AA\ for the ripple amplitude and 10$^{\circ}$ and 26$^{\circ}$ 
for the slopes of the major and the minor sides,
respectively.   Estimates for the bilayer head-head spacings
show that the major side of the ripple is consistent with gel-like structure
and the minor side appears to be thinner with lower electron density.
