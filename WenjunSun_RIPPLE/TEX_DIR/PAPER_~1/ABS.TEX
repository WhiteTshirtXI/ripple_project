The phases of the form factors are derived for the ripple (P$_{\beta '}$)
phase in the lecithin bilayer system. By combining these phases 
with the experimental form factor amplitude data (D. C. Wack and W. W. Webb,
Phys. Rev. A {\bf 40}:2712-2730 (1989)), the electron density map of the 
ripple phase of DMPC is reconstructed. These phases are obtained by fitting 
the above mentioned data to a 2D electron density model, which is constructed 
by convoluting an asymmetric triangular ripple profile with a trans-bilayer 
electron density profile. Accurate ripple structures, which include the ripple 
amplitude, the slopes of both the major and the minor sides of the ripple, the 
degree of ripple asymmetry, the bilayer head-head spacings and the water 
spacings are also achieved from the fit. The major side of the ripple is
found to have the gel-phase like structure. This model method is superior 
to the ``pattern recognition'' method, which is done by finding the correct 
phase combination out of all possible combinations of 20 or so peaks. 
Furthermore, this model provides a more direct, quantitative way of obtaining 
the degree of ripple asymmetry, compared to the qualitative relation of unit 
cell obliquity to ripple asymmetry made by other groups.
