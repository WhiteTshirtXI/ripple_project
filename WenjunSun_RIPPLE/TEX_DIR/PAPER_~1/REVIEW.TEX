\section{Review of available x--ray data and their analysis}

Only a few x--ray works \cite{Tar73,JanSS79,Ale85,Wac89a} reported
measured intensity data of scattering peaks in the ripple phase. Others
\cite{Ino80,Kat95} just have the diffraction pattern and lattice parameters.

1). Powder samples: Tardieu DLPC, 

Tadieu et. al. \cite{Tar73} reported a x--ray film data of the powder sample
of DLPC at $-7^{\circ}$C and $C_w = 23\%$. Their ripple lattice constants
are: $d_s=55.3$\AA, $\lambda_r = 85.3$\AA\ and $\gamma = 110^{\circ}$.
They observed 19 peaks, though 5 pairs of them overlap with each other
and were somewhat arbitrarily partitioned by the authors. After a variety
of procedures were tried, different phases were assigned to each peak
and an electron density profile was obtained. Due to the ambiguities in
intensity partitioning and phase assignment, this result is by no means
final. The authors also reported an estimate of the ripple amplitude
of about 15\AA.

Janiak DMPC, Inoko DL--DPPC (no intensity data), Wack DMPC(best). 2). Oriented
samples: Alecio DPPC(20 orders, with intensity data), Katsaras L-DMPC and
DL--DMPC (recent, best, only diffraction patterns).
