Dear Watt,

	Thanks for your quick response.  However, there is no
special reason to send it to PNAS if you are not acknowledged as
communicating it.  I had rather thought that your 
sending us your reprint at least three times indicated that you
might like to be recognized as a kind of mentor in this work.
Sorry to bother you.

				John
